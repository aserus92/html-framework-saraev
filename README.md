I created test-page with diffrent technologies, like a Flex-Box and Float using classes similar to Bootstrap. Blocks can change depends on the screen (3 gradations: 1200px, 992px, 768px).
In the first part, you can observe the work of the main blocks. The second part demonstrates the behavior of the elements of blocks using the above technologies.
